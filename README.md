# FreezeAnalysis
This repository contains iPython files that can be used to score an animal's motion and freezing while in a conditioning chamber.  It was designed with side-view recording in mind, and with the intention of being able to crop the top of a video frame to remove the influence of fiberoptic/miniscope cables.
