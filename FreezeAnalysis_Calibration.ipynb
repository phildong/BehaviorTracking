By looking at the distribution of frame-by-frame change values for each pixel, a threshold is then set for determining what changes are likely to be attributable to the animal moving versus random fluctuation.  Currently, cutoff is is set to twice the 99.99 percentile.   A plot of grayscale change values is also provided.  Zooming tools to the right of plot can be used to more closely examine low-frequency changes.\n",
